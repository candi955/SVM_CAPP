# SVM_CAPP
# (Support Vector Machine Cyber Attack Prediction Project)
# 
# Th SVM CAPP project takes both the Center for Strategic and Internation Studies (CSIS) cyber event data and The World Bank data 
concerning global events (source data), and then processes that data using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict a 
target event (target data).  The project has  been implemented utilizing the programming language Python, version 3.7, on the Pycharm 
IDE (Integrated Development Environment), as well as the Sci-Kit Learn library SVM algorithm.  Other libraries utilized the SVM CAPP
project include:
# 
# - tkinter
# - numpy
# - pandas
# - xlrd
# 
# The SVM algorithm is a supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm often used for classification and regression purposes.  The term 
# 'supervised' indicates a referenced set of data for set training is involved within the algorithmic process. 
# 
# The referenced datasets are in the project files, and include:
# 
# Gross PSD (Quarterly Public Sector Debt), Central Gov., All maturities, Debt securities, Nominal Value, % of GDP

# World Development Indicator: Global access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking (% of population)# 
# World Development Indicator: Global access to electricity (% of population)
